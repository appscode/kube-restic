# Workload Initializer

Stash operator can be used as a workload [initializer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/extensible-admission-controllers/#initializers). For this you need to create a `InitializerConfiguration` with initializer named `stash.appscode.com`. _Please note that, this uses an alpha feature of Kubernetes_.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f ./hack/deploy/initializer.yaml
initializerconfiguration "stash-initializer-config" created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: InitializerConfiguration
metadata:
  labels:
    app: stash
  name: stash-initializer
initializers:
- name: stash.appscode.com
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - "*"
    apiVersions:
    - "*"
    resources:
    - daemonsets
    - deployments
    - replicasets
    - replicationcontrollers
    - statefulsets
```

This is helpful when you create `Restic` before creating workload objects. This allows stash operator to initialize the target workloads by adding sidecar or, init-container before workload-pods are created. Thus stash operator does not need to delete workload pods for applying changes.

This is particularly helpful for workload kind `StatefulSet`, since kubernetes does not adding sidecar / init containers to StatefulSets after they are created.
