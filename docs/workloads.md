# Supported Workloads

Stash suuports the following types of Kubernetes workloads.

## Deployments
To backup a Deployment, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find the full working demo in [examples folder](/docs/examples/workloads/deployment.yaml).

## Deployments, ReplicaSets and ReplicationControllers
To backup a ReplicaSet, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find the full working demo in [examples folder](/docs/examples/workloads/replicaset.yaml).

## ReplicationControllers
To backup a ReplicationController, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find the full working demo in [examples folder](/docs/examples/workloads/rc.yaml).

## DaemonSets
To backup a DaemonSet, create a Restic with matching selectors. You can find the full working demo in [examples folder](/docs/examples/workloads/daemonset.yaml). This example shows how Stash can be used to backup host paths on all nodes of a cluster. First run a DaemonSet wihtout nodeSelectors. The only purpose of this DaemonSet to act as an vector for Restic sidecar. In this example, we use a `busybox` container for this. Now, create a Restic that has a fileGroup with path `/srv/host-etc` and `sourceVolumeName`

 that mounts the host path you want to backup

## StatefulSets


For enabling the backup process for a particular kubernetes object like `RC`, `Replica Set`, `Deployment`, `DaemonSet` user adds a label `restic.appscode.com/config: <name_of_tpr>`. `<name_of_tpr>` is the name of Stash object. And then user creates the Stash object for starting backup process.
In case of StaefulSet user has to add the restic-sidecar container manually.


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: statefulset-demo
  name: workload
  namespace: default

  replicas: 1

        - mountPath: /etc
          name: stash-podinfo
        - mountPath: /repo
          name: repo
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: stash-scratchdir
      - downwardAPI:
          defaultMode: 420
          items:
          - fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: metadata.labels
            path: labels
        name: stash-podinfo
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: repo
```
